This repository contains the entirety of the source code, including assets, for [1-Bit Murder Theater](https://annoyed-grunt.itch.io/murder-theater). The game was developed in less than 48 hours spread over the course of a week for [MizJam #1](https://itch.io/jam/miz-jam-1).

To reimport the Tiled tileset and tilemap files included, you will need a Tiled importer for Godot. At the time of writing, one written by vnen can be found in Godot's Asset Library.
